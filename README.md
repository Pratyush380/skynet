# SKYNET (Peer to Peer file sharing)
### Overview (Targets)
1. No Peers, distributed storage and search
2. Caching of enteries at multiple nodes for performance
3. Incentives/penalties to foster collaboration 

We use a 3 layered network where

1. Layer 1 : Master Server
2. Layer 2 : Peer Servers (servers in this layer have peer to peer connections)
3. Layer 3 : Clients (connected to servers in layer 2)
